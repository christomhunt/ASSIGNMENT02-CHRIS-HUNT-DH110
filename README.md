## Introduction.

Musictheory.net mobile is a free website where users can learn the basics of music theory.

After conducting a Heuristic Evaluation on musictheory.net mobile I found that sometimes it would be unclear how to go back to the previous item selected onthe website. Secondly, the FAQ section is hidden somewhat at the bottom of the webpage on mobile and even when in the contact us form its in a wall of text. Lastly, the contact us form doesnt tell you what you're missing if you submit a contact form just tells you only one of the items if there is more than one missing.

## Purpose.
