## Introduction and Purpose.

musictheory.net mobile is a free website where users can learn the basics of music theory.

After conducting a Heuristic Evaluation on musictheory.net mobile I found that sometimes it would be unclear how to go back to the previous item selected on the website. Secondly, the FAQ section is hidden somewhat at the bottom of the webpage on mobile and even when in contact we form it in a wall of text. Lastly, the contact us form doesn't tell you what you're missing if you submit a contact form, it just tells you only one of the items if there is more than one missing.

## Methodology.

For the Pilot Usability Test it will take place via Zoom with my Dad (who is similar to the target demographic we are targeting for this study). The moderator (me) and the participant (my dad) will both be on a call over Zoom. The moderator will share their screen of the survey so the participant can see all the information on the survey. The participant will share the screen of their mobile device accessing musictheory.net via Zoom and will also have a laptop connected to zoom so we can see their face since using the phone to share the screen and the camera are not possible via Zoom currently.

## Reflection.

The Pilot Usability Test showed me how I can improve my UT in the future as well as what I can target with the musictheory.net mobile site.

For the Pilot Usability Test this was my first time trying to record a user's screen on their phone and the camera facing them. In this case I had to use a laptop because Zoom isn't capable of sharing the screen on the phone and the camera at the moment. Also the Zoom setting I had seemed to only let one person at a time share their screen so when I shared mine the participants screen stopped sharing which may not seem like a big thing but setting it up may be time consuming for the participant. Secondly, the amount of time it took to complete the task I had planned was faster than I thought. I think it may be due to the instructions I gave holding the participants hand through each step ensuring success. But I also think that the participant (my dad) was a little too tech savvy because he breezed through everything and went through clicking things faster than expected. I want to consider explaining the task as a whole and seeing if the same results would happen.

I think the Pilot Usability Test went very well for the 2nd time conducting a Pilot Usability Test and 1st time conducting my own Pilot UT. In the future I will be able to create a much better UT because of the "fast fails" that I am experiencing. Conducting more UT will help me figure out how to word scenarios to get what I want and make sure I use the participants' time wisely. Also experimenting with other UT applications would be a good option to look into so I can simplify the recording application. Also next time I will ask the user more what they are feeling real time because I felt like I didn't follow up with the participant after a Task so see how they felt even though I ask later on and maybe their feelings changed because of other Task I gave them afterwards or they had more time to think about how they were feeling about a particular issue.
