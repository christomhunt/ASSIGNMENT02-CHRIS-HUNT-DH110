## Introduction and Purpose.

musictheory.net mobile is a free website where users can learn the basics of music theory.

After conducting a Heuristic Evaluation on musictheory.net mobile I found that sometimes it would be unclear how to go back to the previous item selected on the website. Secondly, the FAQ section is hidden somewhat at the bottom of the webpage on mobile and even when in contact we form it in a wall of text. Lastly, the contact us form doesn't tell you what you're missing if you submit a contact form, it just tells you only one of the items if there is more than one missing.

## Methodology

For the Pilot Usability Test it will take place via Zoom with my Dad (who is similar to the target demographic we are targeting for this study). The moderator (me) and the participant (my dad) will both be on a call over Zoom. The moderator will share their screen of the survey so the participant can see all the information on the survey. The participant will share the screen of their mobile device accessing musictheory.net via Zoom and will also have a laptop connected to zoom so we can see their face since using the phone to share the screen and the camera are not possible via Zoom currently.
